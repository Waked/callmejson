# callmejson
A JSON-XML converter as an OOP course project

By Kamil Dzier≈ºanowski, for class lead by dr Piotr Wasiewicz

## Mechanism
callmejson conceptually consists of four modules - an input and an output module for JSON and for XML. It has an engine to handle loaded data, stored as an object tree respective to the document tree.

## Why so complicated
Since this is a project for object-oriented programming class, it has to utilise as much of the paradigm's features as possible, thus I avoid using solutions typical for C in favor of C++'s nuances.
